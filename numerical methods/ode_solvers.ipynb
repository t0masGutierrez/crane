We will mostly be using the [**`solve_ivp`**](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html) function within SciPy, where \"ivp\" stands for **initial value problem**.\n",

This is a very common numerical problem in physics.** Python comes with a few ways to easily solve initial value problems, but here we'll use the `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function. `solve_ivp` allows us to choose from many numerical integrators and ODE solvers such as the [trapezoid method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule) for integration, and higher order Runge Kutta methods (i.e. RK45).\n",
