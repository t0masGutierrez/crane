    "3. Why are we taking the absolute value to plot?\n",
    "4. How do we get the frequency on the x-axis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are my answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Negative frequencies in Fourier space come from reading the data backwards**. The math doesn't know what order your data is supposed to be in, so it goes forward and backward! You are probably now thinking \"aren't the frequencies the same forwards and backwards?\" Yes, yes they are!\n",
    " So Fourier transforms always generate symmetric data with a negative and positive version of whatever frequencies are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **This means you can ignore all the negative frequencies and stick to the positive side of the axis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The fact that our lines aren't perfectly narrow means that there must be small amounts of other freuqncies present**. \"Wait a minute\" you say, \"we just put a single sine wave in???\" That is true, but because our data doesn't start and end perfectly with the cycle of the signals, it has data hanging out on the edges (beginning and end). This makes the algorithm confused when it tries to repeat the signal (imagine making a copy of this signal and taping it onto the end of the original signal-there would be a huge jump where they connect). This makes the algorithm think that there must be little pieces of other frequencies that add to get the drop-offs at the edges. One way to ease this effect is by doing something called [\"windowing,\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function) which basically forces the signal to go smoothly to zero at both ends. This makes it connect nicely when repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why do we take the absolute value? Fourier transforms output data with complex numbers, but we don't want to plot in the complex plane. **By taking the absolute value, we basically sum the real and imaginary legs of the triangle and get the hypotenuse in real numbers that we can plot!**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This is where another function from the numpy.fft package comes in: **fftfreq.** This function will compute the frequency axis for you if you supply the number of data points and the spacing between each:\n",
