Most of the time we are going to be interested in the amplitude, so we'll want to use a function like np.abs() to get the amplitude of the complex value.\n",

Primarily, we'll be working with scipy.fft.fft and scipy.fft.ifft, which are the 1-D Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms. We'll also be using a helper function scipy.fft.fftfreq which makes it easier for us to use our time array from the input data to calculate a frequency array.\n",

If you had a 1 MHz sine wave, but you only sampled it at 1 MHz, then every time you took a measurement the sine wave would have the same value. In this case, it would look just like a constant value rather than a sine wave, so you wouldn't be able to resolve it. It turns out that you can only properly resolve frequencies that are less than half of the sample rate.

This can be accomplished by applying a filter foward in time on a signal, and then applying the filter again except running it backward in time. The result is that the gain for the filter is squared, while the phase response goes to zero. Recall earlier that the filters we were applying had different phases at different frequencies - for a zero-phase filter this is not the case.\n",
